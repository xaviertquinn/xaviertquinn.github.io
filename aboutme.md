# About me

### Hi, I'm Xavier

---
☎️ I spent a year working in Customer Service while searching for the right path for me

Data analytics was recommended to me by a friend and I dove headfirst into the world of data

🔢 I've always been drawn to numbers and order when I was growing up and in school

After leaving school, I went in search of a place that was right for me

I've found it in data and the work I can do with it

---
📊 I've studied data analytics courses with Break Into Tech and Data Analytics Accelerator

In these courses, I've used the following skills to complete projects:
<ul>
  <li>SQL</li>
  <li>Tableau</li>
  <li>Excel</li>
  <li>Google Sheets</li>
</ul>

🎶 When I am not thinking about data analytics, you will find me listening to music or reading books

🎧 I'm a huge fan of Noah Kahan and Sleeping At Last

📖 I just got into cosy fantasy books and love the genre

🐾 And I love spending time with my cat, Ever
