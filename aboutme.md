# About me

### Hi, I'm Xavier

☎️ I spent a year working in Customer Service while searching for the right path for me

Data analytics was recommended to me by a friend and I dove headfirst into the world of data

🔢 I've always been drawn to numbers and order when I was growing up and in school

After leaving school, I went in search of a place that was right for me

Data and the work I can do with it is a big part of that right place for me

<ul>
  <li>SQL</li>
  <li>Tableau</li>
  <li>Excel</li>
  <li>Google Sheets</li>
</ul>

🎶 When I am not working on data projects or learning something new, I'm listening to music or exploring my family history

🎧 I'm a huge fan of Joshua Radin and Sleeping At Last

📖 I really love cosy fantasy books and are always looking for more to add to my "to be read" list

🐾 And I love spending time with my cat, Ever
