#### [DoorDash Excel Project](/doordash)
In this project, I used Excel to analyze a 2.2k dataset for marketing insights that will increase the customer base and company revenue. I focused on:
<ul>
  <li>The age range of customers</li>
  <li>The total amount spent</li>
  <li>The average amount spent</li>
  <li>The average customer use length</li>
</ul>
The marketing insights provided at the end of the analysis list the demographics of customers that should be focused on for future campaigns.
