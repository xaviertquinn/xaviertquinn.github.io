## DoorDash Analytics

### Why DoorDash?

I moved back to Pennsylvania in 2021. Since then, I have been a user of DoorDash for take out and delivery. 

As someone who struggles with finding time to go to the grocery store or make meals, DoorDash has helped me find food near me. 

I became curious about who uses apps like DoorDash and why. Where are they from? How old are they? Do they have family or live alone? 

The chance to look at the data has not only given me insights into the type of customer uses DoorDash but it has given me a new and interesting viewpoint on my own use of food delivery services.
